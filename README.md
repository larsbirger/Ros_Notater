# ROS notes

## python?

[ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) is coded in several languages, but [HVL](https://www.hvl.no/) wants us to mainly use python.
this is understandable due to the versatility of python, but if nessecery, fastly running code
is recomended to run with a purely compiled language and not a runtime compiled to binary interpreted code like python.

## Ubuntu

[ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) is preferrably run on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

- [install Ubuntu 21.04 on WMWare](https://unixcop.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-21-04-on-vmware-workstation-pro/)

## WMWare

there are many ways to run [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), one of those ways is with the use of a [wirtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).
according to [HVL](https://www.hvl.no/), the preferred wirtual machine service in our class is [WMWare](https://www.vmware.com/).
